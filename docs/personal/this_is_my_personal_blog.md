# This is my personal blog. 
I have always been wanting a personal blog. After a long while of pondering and picking what to use for my blog, I got tired of the reluctant, so I just picked whatever on my mind and go with it.

## Hibikiji
As a self-acclaimed weeaboo, I want to use the term `Kiji` (as Article, Writing,... in Japanese), but I also like the character `Hibiki` so I'll just combine it. Yes I know, very tasteless. And the fact that I acknowledge it does not mean it will be less tasteless.

I will be writing about a lot of things. And this blog is mainly for myself to look back after some time.

## What will I write?
I don't know, many many things I think!
From Technology studies to the places I have been, to my own thoughts on many things. I believe that by writing it will keep me sane. And I hope I won't get tired of it.
